| Responsibility | Description                               | Guideline                      | Rationale                                                                    |
| ---             | ---                                       | ---                                  | ---                                                                         |
| Grammar & Spelling | **Ensure impeccable grammar and orthography**. Update any incorrect words or phrases (i.e., spelling errors, miscapitalizations, etc.) | If English isn't your native language, consider utilizing an editorial tool like Grammarly. Remember, accurate word choice enhances clarity and comprehension.                                     |
| Consistency   | **Adapt tone and syntax smoothly**. Keep the existing tense unless there is a compelling reason to change it. Be mindful not to introduce abrupt styles or inconsistencies. Adhere to past simple or present perfect as appropriate. | Maintaining consistency ensures a seamless reading experience since varying voices can detract from the overall narrative unity.                                                           |
| Originality   | **Introduce fresh thoughts devoid of plagiarism**. Adopt unique perspectives while maintaining cohesion with existing plot lines; avoid repurposing preexisting concepts found elsewhere. Harness personal imagination and foster original story elements. A well-rounded cast of characters promoting diversity expands your audience's interest.
